# Unexpected Behavior with Instance Variable Modification in Ruby

This example showcases a potential issue when directly manipulating instance variables using `instance_variable_set`. While useful in certain contexts, this approach can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled cautiously.

**Scenario:**

We have a simple class `MyClass` with an instance variable `@value`.  The `value` method provides access to this variable.  We then modify the instance variable directly using `instance_variable_set`.

**Potential Problems:**

* **Breaking encapsulation:** Directly modifying instance variables bypasses any validation or logic that might be implemented within methods designed for updating the state of the object.
* **Debugging challenges:** When instance variables are modified outside of defined methods, it becomes harder to trace changes and identify the source of errors.
* **Maintaining code consistency:** This approach makes code less predictable and more difficult to maintain, especially in larger projects.

**Best Practices:**

To avoid these issues, always prefer to use accessor methods (`attr_accessor`, `attr_reader`, `attr_writer`) or custom setter methods to manage changes to the object's internal state. This maintains encapsulation, improves code readability, and helps prevent unexpected behavior.
